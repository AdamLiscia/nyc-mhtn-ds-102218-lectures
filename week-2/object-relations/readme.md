1. Describe what is happening in the `environment.py`
  what is each line doing?
  Why do we need to do this?

2. What is happening in seed.py file
  - Note that we can run the `seed` file in interactive mode with the line `python -i seed.py`
  What do we have access to if we do that?  Why?

3. Note that we have an airline class and a flight class.  Describe the relationship between airlines and flights.


4. Build out the following
- Build the following getter and setter methods
  For airline: name, year
    (ie. the year of incorporation)
  For flight: name

  (To do the following, look up class methods and class attributes in Python)
  - Airline.all()
    -> should return all of the Airlines that have been initialized
  - Flight.all()
    -> should return all of the flights that have been initialized
